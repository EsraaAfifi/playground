# Bonus problem: If youâ€™re feeling the need for a little more, write
# a program that picks a random number. Let a player guess the
# number, telling the player whether the guess is too low or too high.
#
# (Hint: rand(10) will generate a random number from 0 to 9, and
# gets will read a string from the keyboard that you can translate to
# an integer.)
